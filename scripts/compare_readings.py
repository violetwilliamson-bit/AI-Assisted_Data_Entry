"""
Merge two independent readings of a site's scan pages into the raw CSV that
build_l0.py takes (procedure step 4).

The first reading's values go into the cells. Every field where the second
reading differs gets an `unclear_flags` note citing the other reading, so the
cell is highlighted and logged for the human check. The second reading's own
notes are carried over too, marked "(2nd reading)". A tag found in only one
reading is kept and flagged as a whole row.

Usage: compare_readings.py <reading1.csv> <reading2.csv> <out_raw.csv>
