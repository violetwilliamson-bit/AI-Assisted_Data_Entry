# Tree Census Data Entry Helper: Working File

## Goal

Build a data entry helper tool that takes scanned, handwritten tree census inventory data sheets and turns them into rows in a spreadsheet.

## Pipeline1

1. **Scan intake**: collect scanned sheets (PDF/JPG/PNG) in one folder.
2. **Preprocess**: deskew, crop, boost contrast, split multi-page PDFs into images.
3. **Layout detection**: find the table and its rows and columns on each sheet.
4. **Recognition (OCR/HTR)**: read the handwriting in each cell.
5. **Validate and review**: flag low-confidence, invalid, or unexpected values for a human to check and correct.
6. **Export**: write the cleaned rows to a spreadsheet (Excel file).

The human review step matters most. Handwriting recognition will make mistakes, so the goal is to reduce typing, not to eliminate checking.

## Validation rules

- Numeric fields (e.g. diameter) must fall within a plausible range.
- Categorical fields (e.g. species code, condition) must match a known list.
- Flag any cell the recognizer is unsure about.

## Inputs (in `data/`)

- `data/protocol/Data Entry Protocol.pdf` — the Data Entry and Cleanup Protocol (L0/L1/L2 definitions, naming convention, entry rules).
- `data/scans/` — scanned datasheet PDFs, one per site: SG-NES1 (20 pages), SG-NES3 (14 pages), CA-CAR3 (11 pages), CC-CVN2 (19 pages). Last page(s) of each = new trees tagged that census.
- `data/template/Forest_Inventory+Mortality_Data_Entry_Template_2024-09-18.xlsx` — the master template (`Data Entry`, `Changelog`, `Issue Log` sheets).
- `data/last_inventory/` — 2021 L2 files per site, used to seed `Site_Name`, `Tag_Number`, `Previous_Tag_Number`, `Tag_Date`, `Sp_Code` for continuing trees, per protocol.
- `data/L0/<site>/` — current L0 data under the verbatim rule: the raw transcription CSV and the built L0 workbook for each site.
- `data/L1/` — your hand-checked workbooks (L1), kept separate so the L0 output is never overwritten.
- `data/archive/2026-09_old_rules/` — the first L0 pass of all four sites (older rules): `csv/`, `L0/`, and `checked/` (your SG-NES1 check). Paths in the progress log below that start with `data/work/csv`, `data/work/output` or `data/work/checked` now live here.
- `data/work/images/` — cropped scan images (regenerable scratch, not committed; `old_format/` holds the crops from the first pass).

## Protocol summary (L0 scope only)

- Enter data exactly as written. Blank field → leave blank + highlight cell. Dash on sheet → literal dash. Checkmark → `=UNICHAR(10004)`. Unclear/wrong entry → still enter it, highlight, and log in Issue Log with the tag number.
- `*_Date` columns (Height_Date, DBH_Date, CII_Date, Crown_Class_Date, Condition_Obs_Date) = date at top of that datasheet page, unless a different date is noted next to an observation.
- Family/Genus/Species/Subspecies/Authority are filled later via a species-code lookup, not typed per row — leave blank at L0.
- New trees (last page(s) of each site's scan set): `Tag_Date` = date tagged that survey (per your instruction), appended after the last existing tag number, increasing by tag number.
- File name format: `<plot_id>_inventory_data_<collection_year>_L0_<YY-MM-DD created>`.

## Pipeline2

1. Render a scan page to a high-res PNG (`pdftoppm`).
2. Transcribe the page by reading the image (Claude vision) into a raw CSV (one row per tree, datasheet column order) — `data/work/csv/`. Anything unclear goes in the `unclear_flags` column instead of being guessed.
3. `scripts/build_l0.py` merges the raw CSV with the prior-inventory lookup and writes rows into a copy of the template, applying the protocol rules above (highlighting, checkmark formula, Issue Log entries).
4. Output lands in `data/work/output/`.

## Decisions

- **Numbers are real numbers.** Height, DBH, DBH_HOM, CII, %Crown/%Leaves Remaining, Degrees Leaning, Wounded Trunk, and Living Length are written as numeric cells (not text) unless the sheet literally has a dash or "NA", which stay as text per protocol.
- **Every Issue Log entry cites its cell**, e.g. `[Data Entry!Y6] Tag 4305: ...`, so you can jump straight to it.
- **Census_Start / Census_End**: use the earliest/latest date written across *all* of a site's datasheet pages (not just one page). Left blank+highlighted until all of a site's pages are transcribed and the full date range is known.
- **Ambiguous page dates** (a page header showing two dates): flagged as an issue rather than guessed — `*_Date` columns left blank+highlighted for those rows.
- **Entry_Personnel**: "Violet Williamson" on every row.
- **Geotag_*, Latitude, Longitude, GPS_File_Name** for continuing trees: left empty at L0, not carried forward from `last_inventory` — pending your check with your PI.
- **Species codes**: not validated against a lookup list — you'll check those manually if needed.

## SG-NES1 scan structure (worth knowing before checking other sites)

The 20-page scan PDF isn't a clean 1:1 page-per-sheet — found while transcribing:
- Sheets are numbered "n/16" in the corner; PDF pages 1–16 map directly to sheets 1/16–13/16, **except** sheet 13 appears three times: page 13 ("13a") has real data for tags 4697–4727, and pages 14 and 15 are two scans of "13b", which looks like a near-blank duplicate **but is not** — it holds the real data for tags 4728 and 4729 (which are blank on 13a). I only entered 13a, so those two rows were incomplete until you fixed them. Lesson: compare apparent duplicate pages row by row before skipping one.
- PDF pages 16–18 = sheets 14/16–16/16 (tags 4730–4822).
- PDF pages 19 and 20 are both the "new trees" addendum (tags 4823–4855, all flagged "out of sequence" with geotag references to nearby trees) — near-identical content scanned/copied twice. Per your call, only entered once (page 19).
- Sheets 12/16 and 13/16 have no date filled in at the top at all — per protocol ("if no date is written at the top, use the last day of the census"), these rows use Census_End (2026-08-10).
- Worth checking the other 3 sites' scans for the same kind of duplicate/blank pages before assuming page count = sheet count.

## What your hand-check of SG-NES1 taught me

I diffed your checked workbook against my original (982 changed cells). What changed, and what I do differently from now on:

| What you fixed | Cause | Now |
|---|---|---|
| 8 × "J" in Height_Method → "T" | Misread; only T/H are valid | Script checks every coded column against the sheet legends and flags anything outside (would have caught all 8) |
| "Dead" in Survival_Status → "D" (46 rows) | I wrote the word instead of the boxed letter | Use the boxed letter; script flags "Dead" |
| Degrees_Leaning / Leaf_Damage swapped on ~12 dead rows | Column misalignment in my CSV for dead rows | Crossed-out rows now use a `crossed_out` flag; script writes them, so no hand-aligned blanks |
| Heights on crossed-out (already-dead) rows removed | That small number is the pre-printed prior-census value, not a measurement | Not entered for crossed-out rows |
| ~63 comments removed | I entered the small **pre-printed** prior-census comments (e.g. "shares base with 4408"); protocol says only enter them if circled | Only handwritten / circled comments |
| Comment placed on wrong row (e.g. 4301 vs 4302) | Handwriting sits between rows | Flag comments that sit between rows instead of guessing |
| "@" → "at", "w/" → "with" | You normalized these | Script does it in Comments / DeathDam mode |
| Two conflicting values kept as "9.9/10.4" | I had kept only the first | Enter both, separated by "/" |
| ~54 heights, a few DBH/HOM digit misreads (e.g. 2.16 → 2.6, 3.6 → 3, 13.2 → 12.2) | Handwriting | Flag digit strings that are unusual for the tree's size |
| Rows 4728 / 4729 filled in | I skipped page 13b (see above) | Compare duplicate pages row by row |
| Crossed-out rows highlighted magenta, whole row | Your convention | Script highlights crossed-out rows magenta |

Confirmed convention for a crossed-out row: only Tag, Prev tag, Sp_Code, DBH_1 = "NA", Survival "D", DeathDam status, degrees leaning / mode if written, plus **all five *_Date columns filled**.

Dates: for the next sites, `*_Date` and new-tree `Tag_Date` default to the **latest date listed on that sheet**, or the **census end date** if the sheet has none (no more blank+highlighted "ambiguous" rows).

Open questions from the diff:
- **Tag_Date is empty in every row of your checked file** (all 522 continuing trees). Deliberate (waiting on your PI), or lost in the export?
- **Degrees_Leaning "0" → "-"** on 67 rows, almost all on sheets 14–16 (tags 4730–4822). On the scan those read as 0s to me. Is a "0" on these sheets meant to be a dash, or is 0 right and "-" your choice?
- Single cells highlighted magenta (mostly DBH_Date on tags 4334–4366 and 4823–4855; also some Wounded_Trunk / Living_Length) — a different meaning from the full-row crossed-out highlight?
- Did you want the SG-NES1 raw CSV / workbook regenerated with these fixes? I left them alone since your checked file is now the better version.

## SG-NES3 (transcribed 2026-09-25)

- 14-page scan = 13 numbered sheets ("n/13", page N = sheet N, no duplicates) + a new-trees addendum (page 14). Page 13's lower half is blank.
- 421 trees: all 408 from the 2021 inventory (tags 7501–7600 and 7901–8208; the 7600→7901 jump is real and matches the 2021 file) + 13 new trees (8209–8221).
- Dates: `*_Date` = latest date on each sheet (8/5 or 8/6; page 7's header lists both, so 8/6). Sheet 3 has no date, so it defaults to the census end (8/6). Census 2026-08-05 to 2026-08-06. New trees use the addendum's date (8/5).
- Crossed-out rows (already dead at the previous census) are magenta-highlighted: 7554, 7558, 7580, 8038, 8183, 8186, 8189 (+ 7990, a dropped tag).
- New-tree geotag ref/dist/dir are folded into the Comment (same as SG-NES1). Six new trees have a geotag ref that disagrees with the tag named in their comment — flagged.
- 65 Issue Log entries (each cites its cell): mostly stray "1" before "90" in % crown/leaves (entered 90), "+" or "N" in Wounded_Trunk / Degrees_Leaning, negative Living_Length (-0.1), and dashes where DBH_HOM would be 0.
- Scan workflow change: `scripts/scan_crops.py` deskews each page and cuts it into zoomed left/right bands; the full-page images were too small to tell digits apart reliably.

## CA-CAR3 (transcribed 2026-09-25)

- 11-page scan = sheets 1/9-9/9, a second copy of sheet 6/9, and a new-trees sheet (page 11, labeled "10/9"). The two copies of 6/9 are complementary, not duplicates: page 6 holds trees 8466-8476 (8477-8498 are blank pre-printed rows), page 7 holds 8477-8498 (8466-8476 blank). Both were used. Same pattern as SG-NES1's sheet 13a/13b.
- 297 trees: all 291 from the 2021 inventory (8301-8591) + 6 new trees (8600, 9903, 9904, 9905, 9907, 9908). Tag 9902 is mentioned on tag 8325's comment ("new tag -> 9902 out of seq") but has no row on the new-trees sheet - worth asking.
- Dates: every sheet is 8/8/26 (page 5 has no date, so it defaults to the census end, which is also 8/8/26). Census start = census end = 2026-08-08.
- 31 crossed-out (already dead) rows, magenta. 54 Issue Log entries.
- New-tree geotag ref/dist/dir are folded into the Comment, as for the other sites. New-tree tag numbers jump 8600 -> 9903 (out of series), all entered in increasing tag order.
- Sheets 5-9 have a dash in DBH_HOM where the other sites write 0 (entered as written; flagged once per sheet).
- Several rows have a line drawn through DeathDam status/mode but real numbers in the rest of the row (e.g. 8485, 8499): entered as read and flagged.

## CC-CVN2 (transcribed 2026-09-28, all 4 sites now done)

- 19-page scan = 17 numbered main sheets (page 7 duplicates 1866-1898 from page 6, but only completes 5 rows — 1894-1898 — that were left partial on page 6; only entered once, using the complete version) + a 1-tree new-trees addendum (page 19; page 18 was blank).
- 534 trees: all 533 from the 2021 inventory (1701-2233, no gaps) + 1 new tree (2234).
- This site's sheets default Wounded_Trunk and Degrees_Leaning to a literal "0" rather than a dash where other sites use "-" — entered as written; the script's global 0-degrees-leaning-to-dash rule still applies on top of that.
- A number of trees are recorded "Dead" (survival D) with real measurements collected this census (e.g. 1704, 1714, 1730) — these are NOT the crossed-out convention; only rows with no real data and a literal strike-through line are crossed_out (6 total: 2014, 2055, 2063, 2170, 2213, 2226).
- Dates: census spans two days, 2026-08-12 and 2026-08-13. One page (page 6 / sheet 6) has no header date, defaulted to the census end date.
- 47 Issue Log entries: mostly "+" or stray letters in Wounded_Trunk/Leaf_Damage/DeathDam_Status that don't match the sheet's legend, plus a handful of overwritten/ambiguous digits.

## All four sites summary

| Site | Trees | New trees | Crossed-out (already dead) | Census dates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SG-NES1 | 555 | 33 | — (not tracked pre-convention) | 2026-08-07 to 2026-08-10 |
| SG-NES3 | 421 | 13 | 8 | 2026-08-05 to 2026-08-06 |
| CA-CAR3 | 297 | 6 | 31 | 2026-08-08 (single day) |
| CC-CVN2 | 534 | 1 | 6 | 2026-08-12 to 2026-08-13 |

All four L0 workbooks are in `data/work/output/`.

## Verbatim L0 revamp (2026-10-05)

You asked for L0 to contain only handwritten marks, exactly as written. Decisions:
- Keep the printed identity data (site, tag, previous tag, tag date, species), taken from the 2021 file. The issue was only the small printed prior-census values and comments being copied.
- Crossed-out handwriting: leave the cell blank and describe it in the Issue Log.
- Drop the 0 to "-", "@" to "at" and "w/" to "with" rewrites, and the "DBH_1 = NA" rule for crossed-out rows.
- Out-of-range or invalid values: enter exactly as written, highlight, and log.
- Pilot SG-NES3 sheet 1 first, then redo all four sites after your check.
- Erased-looking marks: record the darker marks. If only faint writing remains (tag 7520's "cracked trunk"), leave the cell blank and log it.
- New-trees sheet: Previous_Tag_Number = "NA"; its Geotag / Ref / Dist / Dir columns go into Geotagged / Geotag_Association_Ref / _Dist / _Dir (no longer folded into Comments). Geotag_Date, Latitude, Longitude and GPS_File_Name are not on the sheet and stay empty (confirmed by you 2026-10-05: leave them empty for now).
- Issue Log: new Tag_Number and Cell columns (Cell links to the flagged cell); issues sorted by row, then column.

Changes: `build_l0.py` no longer rewrites any value. It takes Sp_Code from the prior file and flags a different handwritten species. It keeps written decimals ("9.0"), accepts several notes per row (`field: note | field: note`), and cites the scan crop in each Issue Log entry. `scan_crops.py` now makes 3 bands x 4 column groups at 200 dpi, so crops are not shrunk when read.

Pilot: `data/L0/SG-NES3/SG-NES3_pilot_p01_p14_L0_26-10-05.xlsx`: sheet 1 (33 trees) + the new-trees sheet (13 trees), 33 Issue Log entries. Raw CSV: `data/L0/SG-NES3/SG-NES3_raw.csv`.

## Messy-page test set (2026-10-19)

Kept apart from the real L0 data in `data/test/`, so the protocol can be tuned before re-running whole sites.
- Pages: CA-CAR3 sheets 6/9-9/9 (PDF p6-10; sheet 6/9 scanned twice with different rows) and CC-CVN2 sheets 7/17 (PDF p8) and 10/17 (PDF p11).
- Output: `CA-CAR3_TEST_sheets6-9_L0_26-10-19.xlsx` (126 trees) and `CC-CVN2_TEST_sheets7+10_L0_26-10-19.xlsx` (66 trees), plus their raw CSVs.
- New check, double reading: this reading was compared with the September reading of the same trees. They disagree on 39 of ~2,860 cells (1.4%), listed in `disagreements_vs_sept_reading.csv` and flagged in each Issue Log. Proposed protocol step: read every page twice independently and flag every disagreement for a human check.
- Open question: sheet 10/17 has header date 8/12 but Notes say "Day 2 8/13/26"; the handwriting changes at tag 2017. All rows dated 8/13 for now (latest-date rule).
- **Your check of CA-CAR3 (2026-10-19)** (`CA-CAR3_TEST_FIXED_...xlsx`): 28 reading errors in 2,520 handwritten cells = **98.9% cell accuracy**; 24 of the 28 were already highlighted for review, and 15 of them were among the double-reading disagreements.
  - Errors by type: overwritten digits in heights/DBH (10), the crew's loopy "0" in Degrees Leaning read as 6/8 or skipped (4), an X-shaped Y in Leaf Damage (3), "BV" for BW (2), two circled living-length values that belong in Living_Length_1 and _2 (4 cells), comment words ("non fixed" -> "now fixed", a stray comma) (2), other single cells (3).
  - New rules (now in `build_l0.py`): struck-through rows are not highlighted; the strike line is entered as "-" in every cell it crosses (also partial strikes and crossed-out handwriting). All dates are date-only. A second living-length value goes to Living_Length_2_M (CSV field `living_length2`).
  - Rebuilt from the same reading with the new rules: `CA-CAR3_TEST_v2_...xlsx` matches your fixed file except the 28 reading errors and one strike cell (8491 Leaf Damage, where the line stops short).
- Later rules (2026-10-19): yellow only on flagged cells (blank cells are not highlighted); every *_Date = the date at the top of the sheet being read (CC-CVN2 sheet 10/17 now 8/12). Both in `build_l0.py`; test files rebuilt.
- Protocol for the PI: [Tree Census L0 Data Entry Protocol](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/16669609-d56b-4472-8506-bf1513931829). You chose to use the checked CA-CAR3 file as the accuracy evidence; CC-CVN2 test check is optional.

## Open items

- [x] Your check of the verbatim pilot (SG-NES3 sheet 1): approved 2026-10-19.
- [ ] **Your check of the messy-page test set** (`data/test/`), then re-enter all four sites under the verbatim rule.

- [ ] **Hand-off (after all four sites are done):** make this reusable by whoever comes next, given the same template and datasheets. Plan: move the valid-code lists and the column map out of `build_l0.py` into a config file; add `requirements.txt`; write a README covering the steps (render + crop scans, transcribe, build, spot-check); document the conventions from the SG-NES1 check. Note for the README: the reading of handwriting is done by Claude looking at the cropped images, so the next person needs an AI assistant with image reading, not just the scripts.
- [ ] **Review `data/work/output/SG-NES1_inventory_data_2026_L0_26-09-24.xlsx` against the scans** — 555 rows, 93 Issue Log entries (mostly the ~99 rows with ambiguous page dates on sheets 1/16, 2/16, and the new-trees addendum; plus ~25 individually-flagged unclear cells — each cites its exact cell).
- [ ] Geotag_Ref/Dist/Dir for the 33 new (out-of-sequence) trees on the addendum page: the template has no dedicated columns matching this sheet's layout, so that data is folded into the Comment field for now — decide whether to add proper columns or leave as-is.
- [ ] Tag 4829's comment references tag 4326 but its Geotag Ref number is 4323 — inconsistency on the sheet itself, flagged in the Issue Log, needs your read of the original.
- [ ] Rows 4728/4729 and 4664/4668 have unusually sparse or odd data on the sheet itself (see Issue Log) — worth a second look at the originals.
